			<h1>Our Story</h1>
			<p>Alexandra Clark was born into a chocolate loving family who wasnʼt surprised at all when at 19, she announced that she had decided to dedicate her life to the art of chocolate. Traveling the world studying her craft as an economist, confectioner and retailer, she felt overwhelmed with questions that no one could seem to answer.</p>

			<p>With $32,000 from a taxi accident that she was in (leaving a chocolate show) Clark opened up her experiment of a shop in the back room of a Coney (read “diner” if youʼre not from Detroit) across the street from her best friendʼs grandpaʼs house.</p>

			<p>Back then, we were open Saturdays only. Our sole sign invited customers to peek in the windows, check us out online and to “Knock Again if You Have Champagne”. Neighbors, friends and family would drop in day by day feeding our enthusiasm, experimentation and creativity eventually garnering national attention for the craftsmanship, attitude and style of Clarkʼs team, known as The Babes Babes Babes.</p>

			<p>Together, they have received acclaim from Bon Appetit, Food &amp; Wine Magazine and Tasting Table, Martha Stewart (American Made Honoree, Brand), Crainʼs (“20 in their 20s”) and Forbes Magazine who named her “The Best Pastry Chef Under 30” (on their list of “30 under 30”).</p>
