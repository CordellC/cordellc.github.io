					<h2>Dr. Isla Miles, DMD, PA</h2>
<p><i>“Dentistry is my passion. It gives me the ability to use the gift of my mind to apply my knowledge, and the gift of my heart to treat my patients with compassion.</i></p>
<p><i>Over the past 15 years, dentistry has given me the perfect balance with my professional and personal life. Most of my patients who come to see me for the first time have experienced dental anxiety, and I pride myself on the fact that by the time they leave, they are no longer afraid of the dentist. I like interacting with my patients, not only by providing dentistry in a caring and comfortable manner, but also by discussing in detail how to maintain their dental health so that they can retain their own teeth for a lifetime.”</i>
	<br>
	– Dr. Miles</p>

<h3>Commitment to Education</h3>
<p>A firm believer in providing quality care, Dr. Isla Miles went to the University of North Dakota to complete her Advanced Education in General Dentistry after completing her Doctorate of Dental Surgery. Since then, Dr. Miles has completed over 450 hours of continuing education courses to keep up with the latest advancements in dental technology. She is a member of the American Dental Association and the Academy of General Dentistry.</p>

<h3>Outside the Office</h3>
<p>When Dr. Miles is not in the office, she enjoys spending time with her family and playing with her three children, the youngest of whom is six months old. Her hobbies include playing tennis and reading. She is also active in the community and involved with ensuring quality education for children.</p>
